# Data-Analysis-Real-project
Data Analysis project done for a real client (retail company)

The main purpose of the project was to indicate the average client of the company. Company is mainly focused on selling cloth, while also selling other goods such as backpacks, cups etc. I was sent the raw data gathered from clients in a 1 month period. I first cleaned the data, as some of the data input options were not discrete (e. g. you could indicate string value for age) and there were NaN's all over the place. I replaced those with 0's for a start, as later I did not include them in analysis, since 0 value here meant that age was not indicated in the first place.
